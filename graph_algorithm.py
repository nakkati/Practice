"""
graphs are used to represent relationships between things.
G = (V,E), vertices are also nodes. E is edges or connections between nodes. 
Data structures to represent the graphs:
        Adjacency matrix
        Adjacency list
Graph traversal:
        BFS using queues for discovered but not processed - finding paths, connected paths
        DFS using stacks - finding cycles
Topological sort on directed acyclic graph (DAGs) where nodes are represented in a line
where edges go from from left to right

Weighted graphs:

Minimum spanning trees:
    Prims minimum spanning trees
    Kruskal algorithm - minimum spanning tree for sparse graphs
    Union find data structure for Kruskal algorithm?

Shortest paths:
    Dijkstra's algorithm
    All pairs shortest path
    Floyd's algorithm
    Network flow's and bipartite matching

Randomized min-cut
